2. Enter `c_connect(IP_ADDRESS[, PORT[, PASSWORD]])`

NB: If the host is running a different version of the game, you won't be able to connect or see their world in your **Browse Games** list. [[link](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/42693-stuck-on-old-version-server-mismatch/)]

NB: The default port is `10999`.

See `Documents\Klei\DoNotStarveTogether\Cluster_...\cluster.ini` to get `master_ip` and `master_port`.
